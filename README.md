# Todo WebApp written in Rust using Yew.rs, with trunk as the backend

This will compile to HTML, CSS, JavaScript and WebAssembly.

For a simple back end I am using the trunk rust crate, found at <https://crates.io/crates/trunk>.

```
cargo install trunk
```

Then, in the cargo project directory, run ->

```
trunk serve
```

Trunk will compile the project and host the project live on port 8080.
